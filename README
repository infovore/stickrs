Some silly stickers you can make out of your Flickr images.

Description
-----------

The mainy code resides in an abstract class to handle grabbing photographs from flickr and turning them into somewhat surreal stickers. Any "working" processor should subclass that and implement a #process_each_image method, which should return an array of images ready for writing.

Samples
-------

There are two example scripts here, Both are somewhat surreal.

dadaist-photos.rb
-----------------

This is a very silly script. What it does, in a nutshell:

1) Gets your n latest photographs from Flickr
2) For each picture it:
	a) Calculates the "average" colour of the picture
	b) Generates a square image
		i) With the background colour set to that average colour
		ii) And with the title of the photograph overlaid in white text

It generates square images so that you can produce stickers of your photos on MOO.com.

You now have stickers that are far higher fidelity than any photograph could be at 300dpi.

stripy-photos.rb
----------------

This is less silly, and perhaps more aesthetically pleasing:

1) Gets your n latest photographs from Flickr
2) For each picture it:
	a) Turns it into a 300x300 square
	b) Takes the central row of pixels in that square
	c) Replaces every row of pixels in the square with the central row.
	
The net result is an often aesthetically pleasing series of stripy squares.

Usage
-----

Copy config.yml.sample to config.yml and fill it out with:
	- your Flickr API key
	- your MOO API key
	- FTP details for a server you own.
	
then:

ruby name-of-script.rb flickr-short-username limit-number-of-pictures

Requirements
------------

ImageMagick
RMagick
Hprciot
Flickr API key
MOO API key

Limitations
-----------

Currently, it'll only generate square images.
It doesn't post to the MOO API yet.
